# JS Experiments

A curated collection of small JavaScript projects exploring core front-end concepts through creative experimentation. These projects revisit foundational techniques with a fresh perspective — emphasizing clean logic, browser APIs, DOM manipulation, and interface interaction — all in service of refining fluency in vanilla JavaScript.

This repo serves as both a sandbox for hands-on problem solving and a showcase of front-end fundamentals in motion.

## Projects Include

- **Etch-A-Sketch** – A browser-based Etch A Sketch clone using JavaScript and DOM manipulation to draw by hovering over a grid.
- _(More coming soon as experiments evolve)_

## Goals

- Sharpen fluency in plain JavaScript without frameworks
- Practice readable, modular code patterns
- Rebuild key concepts (loops, conditionals, events, state) with deeper understanding
- Experiment with small but polished browser-based interactions
